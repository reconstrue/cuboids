* Reconstrue Cuboids

** Rational
Reconstrue Cubiods is simply a label for a collection of proven
software which deals with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_rendering][volumetric data]], all of which is licensed in
a commercially friendly manner. For example, any GPL licensed code is
[[https://youtu.be/SNTzOBKs1bA?t=96][right out]].

Most of the software labeled "Reconstrue Cuboids" is actually third
party i.e. written by people who are not part of the organization,
Reconstrue. "Reconstrue Cuboids" is simply a label on source code
denoting that it has been exercised by Reconstrue and found to be
suitable to task. The community value of this exercise is that
corporate entities (Reconstrue included) can build upon the code and
not have to consult with lawyers up-front, thereby increasing the rate
of open source innovation. For more on the rational behind this, see
[[https://github.com/reconstrue/presentations/blob/master/bioimage_2019/bioimage_2019_poster.pdf][Reconstrue Stack]].

** Data Structure
As the name implies, the core data abstraction is cuboids. A cuboid,
[[https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Cuboid.html][as defined by Wolfram]], is a "closed box composed of three pairs of
rectangular faces placed opposite each other and joined at right
angles to each other." Identically shaped cuboids are used to
tesselate a volume.

Reconstrue Cuboids is software used for dealing with neuroimaging
datasets, which regular get into the petabyte scale. Some of the
software can actually handle petabytes of data on commercial cloud
services (e.g. [[https://bossdb.org/][BossDB on AWS]]) and some runs on a single machine
(e.g. [[https://github.com/aplbrain/bossphorus][Bossphorus]]). By focusing on the APIs and data protocol, code can
be developed which can be scaled to multiple hardware deployment.
