* Reconstrue Cuboids

[[by_topic/cuboids/cuboids_brandmark.png]]
  
Reconstrue Cubiods is simply a label for a collection of proven
software which deals with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_rendering][volumetric data]], all of which is licensed in
a commercially friendly manner. For example, any GPL licensed code is
[[https://youtu.be/SNTzOBKs1bA?t=96][right out]].

The following are codebases that have been adopted into Reconstrue Cuboids:

** Rational

Most of the software labeled "Reconstrue Cuboids" is actually third
party i.e. written by people who are not part of the organization,
Reconstrue. "Reconstrue Cuboids" is simply a label on source code
denoting that it has been exercised by Reconstrue, and found to be
suitable to task. These are tools that have been used together in
projects. In that way Reconstrue's early contribution is in working
out component integration, both technically and legally. For example,
one project involves a system which uses [[https://bossdb.org/][bossDB]] with [[https://github.com/seung-lab/chunkflow][chunkflow]] to
reconstruct nuerons from brightfield microscope image stacks.

Beyond tactical progress on any given project, the strategic
community value of this exercise is that corporate entities
(Reconstrue included) can build upon the code and not have to consult
with lawyers up-front, thereby increasing the rate of open source
innovation. For more on the rational behind this, see [[https://github.com/reconstrue/presentations/blob/master/bioimage_2019/bioimage_2019_poster.pdf][Reconstrue
Stack]].

** Data Structure
As the name implies, the core data abstraction is cuboids. A cuboid,
[[https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Cuboid.html][as defined by Wolfram]], is a "closed box composed of three pairs of
rectangular faces placed opposite each other and joined at right
angles to each other." Identically shaped cuboids are used to
tesselate a volume.

Reconstrue Cuboids is software used for dealing with neuroimaging
datasets, which regular get into the petabyte scale. Some of the
software can actually handle petabytes of data on commercial cloud
services (e.g. [[https://bossdb.org/][BossDB on AWS]]) and some runs on a single machine
(e.g. [[https://github.com/aplbrain/bossphorus][Bossphorus]]). By focusing on data structures, wire protocols, and
API code can be developed which can be scaled to multiple hardware
deployment.
