* The Neu Boss Proposal

[[./aux/aws_pitcher.png]]

This document proposes modifications to bossDB such that deploys
involve less server management.  These modification drink deeply from
the AWS Kool-Aid pitcher: more serverless and fully managed services.

** Terminology

In order to distinguish references to the existing and proposed
codebases, the following terms will be used throughout this document:
- ~bossDB~: the existing codebase, as originally named
- ~neu_boss~: the proposed modified codebase

There seems to be a trend in JHU/APL's documentation to casually refer
to the codebase as "the Boss" but here the goal is to distinguish two
variants so the original name "bossDB" is used herein.

At the risk of ruining the humor, `neu_boss` is a word play on "new" (as
in Coke) and "neural." The term also follows the trend of dropping the
"DB" part of the name. Yes, “[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bossa_nova][bossa nova]]” -- literally “new trend” --
would also be a great name but would lose the "neural" implication.

So, let's [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHhrZgojY1Q]["meet the new boss, same as the old boss."]]
 
** Philosophy: drink more AWS Kool-Aid


The original purpose of [[https://bossdb.org/][BossDB]] has been to house the dataset for [[https://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/research-programs/microns][the
MICrONS project]], which is around 2.5 petabyte of data. The codebase 
was started in the early days of serverless, and since then a lot has
changed. But for its main purpose: why fix what isn't broke. Nonetheless,
if it is to be deployed more widely then why not make it much easier to
deploy? Ergo, let's noodle what a refresh would look like architecturally.

BossDB was an old-school open source car with an AWS serverless turbo-boosed engine dropped in.
That engince can only run on planet AWS so, while in Rome do like the Romans.

The core of bossDB will  MICrONS data will probably never leave AWS. So, the code the works
with it will probably never leave AWS. Ergo, by going all-in with AWS
technology management of the system could be simplified.

How labs can cache the MICrONS data and annotate.


** Architecture overview

Consider Figure 7 from [Kleissas et alia, 2017]

[[./aux/kleissas_et_alia_2017_figure_7.png]]

In this document this image will be used as the basis of a butcher's cut chart to illustrate the proposed architectural changes.
The following diagrams are whiteboard over-drawings of Kleissas et al, 2017, Figure 7.

** The server core

This essentially stays the same. The only changes would be at its
interface to the auth and audit system. Also related is how they are
generated. It is proposed to drop Heaviside and adopt AWS CDK in stead.


** Arch of BossDB

As is the architecture of BossDB can be considered a hybrid
architecture which served its purpose well. "Hybrid" here means
consisting of "old-school" pre-serverless machinery, with a turbo
booster of serverless tech bolted on. The goal of this refresh is
to un complicate the hybrid architecture by adopting **more** AWS
product in the BossDB codebase.

The following are the high level changes proposed

| Existing              | Proposed                   |
|-----------------------+----------------------------|
| Hybrid architecture   | Pure AWS architecture      |
| Self-managed services | Fully managed service      |
| Lotta set-up          | Deploy via CloudFormations |
|                       |                            |

The JHUAPL team has a lot of experience grown out of the Hubble
project.  As such they brought that knowledge with them while working
on BossDB.  For example, various proven open source tools for storing
secrets, managing single sign-on, RESTful API request handling,
etc. None of that is particularly interesting, and why not just reuse
what they already knew. Also note that

The core engine of BossDB is built upon AWS severless technology:
Lambda, SQS, DynamoDB, Step Functions, etc. The rest of it is consists
of proven non-serverless technologies.

The main goal of this project is to de-hybridize the architecture by
going all-in on AWS technologies which have been introduced by Amazon
in the interim since the BossDB codebase was initiated. It is arguably
a bit perverse for open source to be tuned up just for a single commercial
cloud platform, but the hypothesis herein is that by doing so it will
make it much easier for other organizations to deploy BossDB, thereby
speeding up the diffusion of innovation. Ideally the other cloud providers
would have equivalent tech to those parts of AWS used in the BossDB refresh,
but sadly that is not the case in mid-2020.

** Specific changes

| Existing | Proposed |
|----------+----------|
|          |          |

Moving to Cognito will simplify per tenant billing and logging.


*** Open questions

- How does bossDB deal with Redis? Is it fully managed?
